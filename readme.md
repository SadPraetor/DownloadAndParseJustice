# Download and Parse of data from government API

## Description
This task was given to my former mentee and I found it interesting, and complex enough to play around with. Initial task was given for a job interview and solution was to be written in UiPath, which is build upon WWF and .NET Framework.<br>
API allows to download uncompressed, or compressed (.gz) files, containing either CSV or XML data. Files themselves uncompressed can reach size of 5GB, so that presents first challenge. <br>
Secondly, CSV file contains main portion of data in ECON format, and is difficult to work with, XML also has a complicated structure. 
Task itself originally asked to save data into Excel file, i will replace this part with insert into DB.
